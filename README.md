# SMSWeatherAlert
## SMS weather alert using Twilio and openweathermap api 

This project uses **2 API services**

**Twilio** for sending text messages

twilio.com

Getting a from phone number and using their API for basic test messaging is very cheap. For example sending one text message a day will cost around $1 per month. One you are setup with Twilio you will need to enter "account_sid" and "autho_token"

**Open Weather Map API**

https://openweathermap.org/api

You need to get api_key and enter in the mail program

You need to host this program somewhere where it can run automatically on a certain time of the day. I set it to run around 10pm every night and use **pythonanywhere.com**

Also you will need to enter your twilio from number and to number of the phone you are seding the SMS alert.
